IN this case while loop would be suitable since this is a conditional loop and our condition to exit the loop depends on the user input
for loop can not be used since the number of interations are not fixed they are depeneded on the user it 
using while loop , if user enters zero ..we will exit the loop using condition " while(num!=0){}
